## Prerequisites

When compiling, the `-std=c++17` and `-fopenmp` flags are required.
For MacOS, can build and run with `g++ -c -std=c++17 -fopenmp -O3 -march=native **/*.cpp && g++ -fopenmp **/*.o && ./a.out`.

## Classes

### Grid

A dense storage system for the game of life.

#### Properties

| Name      | Type                | Description                                     |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| nrows     | `int`               | number of rows                                  |
| ncols     | `int`               | number of columns                               |
| cells     | `std::vector<bool>` | stores the state (dead or alive) of each cell   |
| new_cells | `std::vector<bool>` | temporary storage of updated states             |
| parallel  | `bool`              | whether to apply parallelisation in the methods |

#### Methods

`num_neighbours`: returns the number of alive neighbours of a cell
`to_file`: creates a `.dat` file of 0's and 1's representing the states of the cells
`do_iteration`: compute next generation of the grid cell states, either in serial or parallel
`do_iteration_serial`: compute next generation of the grid cell states in serial
`do_iteration_parallel`: compute next generation of the grid cell states in parallel
`time_data_to_file`: writes timings to .dat file
`dense_to_COO`: shared pointer, converts `Grid` object to `COOGrid` object

### COOGrid

A sparse equivalent of `Grid` using coordinate list (COO) storage.

#### Properties

| Name       | Type                               | Description                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| nrows      | `int`                              | number of rows                                      |
| ncols      | `int`                              | number of columns                                   |
| coords     | `std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>` | vector of pairs of (x, y) coordinates of live cells |
| new_coords | `std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>` | temporary storage of updated coordinates            |
| parallel   | `bool`                             | whether to apply parallelisation in the methods     |

#### Methods

`do_iteration_serial`: compute next generation of the grid cell states in serial
`do_iteration_parallel`: compute next generation of the grid cell states in parallel
`COO_to_dense`: shared pointer, converts `COOGrid` object to `Grid` object

## Testing

As a test framework, we are using [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest), chosen because it's lightweight and doesn't have a huge impact on compile or run times. The doctest header is included in `./doctest.h` and tests should be added in `./tests.cpp`.

To run this program without tests, add the `--no-run` flag when running the executable.

The tests are executed for the `Grid` method `do_iteration` and the `COOGrid` methods `do_iteration_serial` and `do_iteration_parallel`. 

### Tests
1 - First Iteration for "Block" Creation: 5x6 grid forming a "block" after first iteration

2 - Test for 10x10 Grid: Elementwise accuracy check for an iteration over a 10x10 grid

3 - Steady State Check: Iterates twice over the first test's input to check if steady state is achieved (since the "block" does not change)

4 - Generation Counter Check: Tests accuracy of `generation` (for `Grid` method `do_iteration` only)
